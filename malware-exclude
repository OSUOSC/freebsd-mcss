# Anti-malware Exclude File
# 
# This file contains a list of files or directories to exclude from the
# anti-malware scan.  Each file or directory should appear on a separate
# line, and content after a '#' are considered comments.  Make sure that
# directories do not end with a trailing '/' or things won't work as
# intended.  A directory entry will block scanning from traversing down
# that subdirectory tree.  Each entry is checked in the anti-malware
# script, and if the value points to a directory it is treated as a
# directory exclude, while any other value is treated as a pattern exclude
# (used to block a file in this case), so if blocking directory traversal
# is desired, make sure the full path is correct with no trailing slash.

# These are directories that should be excluded by default on Fedora.
# Some exclusions are mandatory, so don't remove these.

# Uncomment the line below to block scanning /home *only* if /home is mounted
# over NFS or is a network filesystem mount.  If that is the case, it should be
# scanned on the fileserver, not from a client over the network.
#/home

# Add any other NFS or network filesystem mounts below.  Be sure to use the
# full path the parent directory, and do not leave a trailing '/'.  For
# example, if you mount some directories from a fileserver under a /data
# directory, add /data below.
