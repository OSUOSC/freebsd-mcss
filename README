# TODO: This should detail how to install software.

Run the install.sh script from this directory to install the MCSS software:

sudo ./install.sh

This installs in /root/mcss.  The MCSS software can be removed with:

sudo /root/mcss/uninstall.sh

Keep in mind the MCSS software is required in order to remain connected to
the CSE network.  Report any errors to CSE computing staff.
